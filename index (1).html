           <h2> smart park automation</h2>
             <h2>problem </h2>
           <p>The number of vehicles are now increasing over the number of total persons in the family. This problem is increasing at such an extend that 40\% of the roads are being  used for parking in normal working days. Due to lack of navigation space, accidednts rates increased exponatially The increasing number of vehicles on road has led to the emergence of a major problem in cities in the form of lack of adequate parking space. Parking is also a major challenge in crowded areas like shopping malls, hospitals, and institutes. Hence this work aims to
  present an automatic real-time system for automated vehicle parking.</p>

             <div class="solution">
             <h2>solution</h2>
               <p> This system has been implemented with the help of the internet of things (IoTs) which exchange information or data between the physical devices. The proposed system has been implemented with the help of Raspberry Pi Pico and esp8266 to connect parking area with web or internet. The proposed system incorporated an infrared sensor in each slot for getting information about the vacancy position of the parking slot and an amount will be displayed based on the time taken by vehicle. Every user has a registered RFID tag which helps to manage parking space and a smart car parking app to find parking slots in less time. And also provides remote booking </p>
